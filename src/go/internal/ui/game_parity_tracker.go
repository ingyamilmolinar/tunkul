// parityTracker groups the parity-diagnostics state that cross-checks the audio
// scheduler against the DrumView slate (see game_parity_*.go). It is embedded
// anonymously in Game so existing g.parityRing / g.parityGen / g.parityScan* …
// call sites keep resolving via field promotion; extracting it just lifts these
// ~20 diagnostic fields out of the ~490-field Game struct into one cohesive unit.
//
// The parity methods themselves stay on *Game: they read Game's beat/timeline/
// predictor state (beatInfoAtRow, rowPastExclusive, timelineCommittedWithKind, …)
// so moving them here would only trade promotion for a Game back-pointer.
//
// Concurrency: parityMu guards parityAudio / paritySeqDecisions (written by the
// sequencer/audio side, read by the comparator). parityGen and parityGraceUntilNS
// are the cross-thread coordination spine and MUST stay atomics — they are read
// from the audio thread, the scheduler, and the comparator without holding a lock.
// This struct is embedded by value in *Game (never copied), so the lock/atomics
// stay in place; parityTracker itself must never be copied.
